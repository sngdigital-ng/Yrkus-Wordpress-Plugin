# yrkus-wordpress-pulgin
This plugin integrates your WordPress site directly with the Yrkus URL shortening service. It adds a simple "Generate Yrkus Link" button to your post and page editor, as well as the main post list.  When clicked, it sends the post's permalink to your secure Yrkus API endpoint, gets the short URL back, and saves it to the post's metadata.
